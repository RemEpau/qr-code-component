## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla

### What I learned

I've learned to use to use Flexbox and how to center elements by using `justify-content` and `align-items`

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  [...]
}
```

### Continued development

I still want to learn more about how Flexbox, and eventually Grid layouts, the next major step would be to remember some syntaxes!
It's just the beginning and I can't wait to make more!

### Useful resources

- [Firefox MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me quite a lot with CSS and HTML in general whenever I needed to document myself.
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU) - An amazing person that motivated me to start working with HTML and CSS.
